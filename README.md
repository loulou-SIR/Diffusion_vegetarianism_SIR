# SIR_model

This is the source code for the master thesis "Modelizaci贸n epidemiol贸gica de la propagaci贸n de comportamientos ambientales en una poblaci贸n". 

Code is written in Python and uses the several imported modules :
  - matplotlib pyplot for plotting
  - Networkx for generating and managing networks 
  - Epidemics on Networks (EoN) for simulating the spread of an opinion through networks, following epidemiological models like SIR
 
The idea is that each node represents an individual that can either be Suceptible (S), Infected (I), or Recovered (R) in regards to the opinion.
