# SIR_model

This is the source code for the master's thesis "Modelizaci贸n epidemiol贸gica de la propagaci贸n de comportamientos ambientales en una poblaci贸n". 

Code is written in Python and uses the several imported modules :
  - Networkx for generating and managing networks 
  - Epidemics on Networks (EoN) for simulating the spread of an opinion through networks, following epidemiological models like SIR
  - Classic Python libraries: matplotlib, scipy, random, time
